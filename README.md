A simple and elegant counter application built using React Native.

Uses useState for smooth and efficient state management.

Displays the current count with a clean and readable UI.

Includes three core actions for controlling the counter:

Increment → Increases the count by one

Decrement → Decreases the count but never below zero

Reset → Instantly resets the count back to zero
